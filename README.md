 Settlement Reports

Payments (settlement) reports provide a detailed breakdown of your account activity for a given settlement period. By reviewing a Payments report, you can understand your account activity.

When you first register, Amazon settles your account approximately 14 days later. After the first disbursement, the process repeats regularly. You can view your next settlement date on the Payments page on the Reports tab.
